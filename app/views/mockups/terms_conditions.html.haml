      # FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC - TERMS AND CONDITIONS

      ##  I.  Introduction

      FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC, an Ohio limited liability company, operates and owns the rights to Dynasty Owner, this Web site, and all of its contents.
      Dynasty Owner is a unique and patented fantasy football game. We ask that you pay close attention to these terms and conditions (referred to as the “Agreement”), as they will constitute a binding legal contract once you agree to participate in Dynasty Owner. If you choose not to accept any term of this Agreement, then you are ineligible to participate and we ask that you take no further action with this Web site. FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC may change the terms of this Agreement from time to time. We will you inform you of changes. Your continued participation will be considered an acceptance of any of the new or altered terms.
      ##  II. Eligibility
      To participate in Dynasty Owner, you must be at least eighteen (18) years old, or have the permission or a parent or guardian to participate.  If local laws stipulate an age of majority higher than 18 years of age, the participant must have reached that age of majority to participate. Dynasty Owner is void where prohibited by law. Regretfully, participants from the following states, territories, and provinces are not permitted to participate due to local laws: Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana, Montana, Washington, Vermont, Quebec, and Puerto Rico. Although this Web site may be accessible worldwide, we make no representation that materials on this Web site are appropriate or available for use in locations outside the United States, and accessing them from territories where their contents are illegal is prohibited.
      ## III.    Payments
      All currency references are in U.S. dollars. Payments are non-refundable unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. Your credit card will be automatically billed upon your registration. Once you have signed up for one year, there is no obligation to continue playing in the following seasons. We do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price drop or promotional offering. In any season in which you participate, you are required to, at all times, maintain a minimum account balance of ________ Dynasty Dollars (the “Minimum Balance”). In the event your account balance falls below the Minimum Balance, you authorize FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC to automatically charge your credit card to replenish your account to reach the Minimum Balance – with or without notice to you. (Michael, we are trying to figure out if there will be a minimum or not now.  The thought is that we will allow people to go into the negative but when they are in the negative, they will be locked out of any game play or changes to their team until they do give us money to make them in the positive with the minimum purchase of $10MM dynasty dollars) That’s fine. We will need to create a new provision that allows for the lock-out. Just let me know when you settle on the solution.

      ## IV. Termination
      FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your Service at any time for any reason, without notice to you, and to suspend your access to the Web site and its data. These reasons include, but are not limited to: (a) Your credit card is invalidated or payment is refused for any reason, (b) You charge back to your credit card the fees due, (c) FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC comes to believe in its sole judgment that you have provided false registration information, or (d) FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC otherwise believes in its sole judgment you have acted in a manner inconsistent with the spirit or the letter of this Agreement.
      ## V.  Judging
      The scoring and other rules of Dynasty Owner are provided in the League Rules, which are posted on the Web site. These rules are incorporated in this Agreement as if they were fully written herein. FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC reserves the right to change the League Rules from time to time in its sole discretion. FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC will be the sole and final judge in all matters and disputes relating to Dynasty Owner. As you know, fantasy football is a game where users must meet important deadlines. Your failure to meet deadlines or participate in certain events within Dynasty Owner may hinder your chances to succeed, and you assume all such responsibility. FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC may refuse teams with names that it believes to be inappropriate or offensive.
      ## VI. Transfers of Teams and Dynasty Dollars

      Dynasty Dollars are only transferrable as provided in the League Rules. Dynasty Dollars have no established cash surrender value, and you have no right to demand from FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC the right to any consideration in exchange for Dynasty Dollars.  This is somewhat incorrect…you can trade for dynasty dollars for players or draft picks ( we are not allowing dollars for dollars trades), so they are transferrable in a sense.  And when we get the marketplace done, during the season, we will be able to allow players to sell their dynasty dollars) This is more for legal purposes. I don’t want to fend off a lawsuit from some whacko who wants to cash out, and can’t understand why he can’t get the same value for DD as he originally paid for the DD. But I see your point for marketing purposes. I added the word “established” above as a happy medium.

      ## VII.    Rules

        A.  Only one Dynasty Owner team is available per person, e-mail address, and credit card number. Each individual is permitted to control only one team per  (Michael, I don’t know if we will do this or not but there has been discussion that each person can operate 1 team for each LEVEL of play. So if we have a $250 league and a $500 league, we MAY allow it. But we haven’t decided…just make note for future discussion) OK. There’s no problem with that. season. You agree not to circumvent this important policy by using an alias, colluding with another owner or team, or otherwise. FRONT OFFICE MEDIA LLC will not tolerate cheating or collusion.
