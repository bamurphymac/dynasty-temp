# This document describes valid player positions and common aliases for them.
# It is used mainly by the seed file for the player database to map the odd
# position values to the normalized ones contained here.

# This object consists of positions that we want to create
# a position group for. The "aliases" array is to only contain
# position strings which can't be inferred from the position
# value in the database. Values starting with the position
# key or name are inferred automatically.
